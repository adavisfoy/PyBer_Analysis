# PyBer Ride-Sharing Data Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was provide a summary of PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type utilizing a Pandas Dataframe. We also utilize matplotlib to provide a data visualization in the form of a multiple-line chart to illustrate the total fares for each city type. The goal of this analysis was to help PyBer leadership make business decisions that could improve access to ride-sharing services and accessibility for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Results: 

### Summary DataFrame: 

The first part of our PyBer Analysis involved merging two data sets, ride_data and city_data, based on the shared "city" column. We then created multiple Pandas series for the metrics outlined below. We merged these series into this PyBer Summary DataFrame:



Highlights of the differences in ride-sharing data amongst the different city types include: 

- **Total Rides:**
  - There are 13 times more rides in urban areas versus rural areas. There are 2.5 times more rides in urban areas vs. suburban areas. This makes sense from a common sense perspective given the population density in urban versus rural cities; however, it is likely that this dramatic difference may lead to disparities in access to Pyber's ride-sharing services.   
- **Total Drivers: **
  - There is a dramatic difference in the number of drivers in urban areas versus rural areas. There are nearly 31 times more drivers in urban versus rural areas. While this is expected to a certain extent, this large disparity in the number of drivers leads to significantly higher demand and higher prices for rural customers. 
- **Total Fares: **
  - Despite there being 31 times more drivers in urban areas than rural areas, total fares in urban areas are only 9 times higher than rural fares. This indicates that higher costs are being passed on to rural customers due to markedly reduced number of drivers in rural cities. 
- **Average Fare per Ride: **
  - As a result of the markedly low number of drivers in rural areas, the average fare per ride is highest in rural areas.
  - Rural customers pay nearly 30 percent more per ride than their urban counterparts. 
  - Suburban customers pay about 21 percent more than urban customers.    
- **Average Fare per Driver: **
  - 
- **Total Fare by City Type: ** 

## Summary: 

Based on this analysis, we would like to offer three business recommendations to our CEO and board to address disparities between the city types: 
- Recommendation 1: 
- Recommendation 2: 
- Recommendation 3:
